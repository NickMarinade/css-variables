# css-variables

> A static web page built with only HTML, CSS & JavaScript. This project uses css to declare variables and mousemove and change events to update user's image with new spacing, blurriness and color.

> Studying this project we learned about:

* Declaring variables in CSS.
* Assigning variables to an object using CSS.
* How the `.querySelectorAll` can be used to reach all the inputs from the page. 
*(It will return to you all the elements from the DOM)*.
* What is`.dataset`*(It's an object that will contain all the attributes from that specific element)*.
 
> This code was well organized before `development-strategy`!
